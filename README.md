# The Jungle Rhythms workflow

## Use case

This repository provides the basis for the Jungle Rhythms project's pre- and post-processing. However, this repository can also serve as a template for other data recovery project, especially those in which the forms used are fairly regular in nature.

## Introduction

The Jungle Rhythms workflow relies on manual template. In particular, it addresses the issue of outlining locations in a table which contain data, and reducing the complexity of the transcription. As such the workflow will generate data which only presents one unit of interest (a year) at a time for annotation, limiting the chance of propagating errors in incomplete or corrupted series. At the same time this makes the task easier to complete in informal settings, on a cellphone or a tablet rather than a computer.
